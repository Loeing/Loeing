<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bio</h3>

<p>My name is Joshua Lee Tang. Born and raised in Paris, I have traveled the world quite a bit in my youth, leading me to be able to speak in five languages, three of which I can speak fluently. After graduating highschool with a Baccalaureat Scientifique, I started attending Case Western Reserve University, where I am currently a student. I am currently pursuing (and very close to getting) a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The summer of my Freshman year, I accidentally became the main developer for a startup that has long since disappeared. My sophomore year, I interned at Bird electronics and worked on connecting one of their sensors to an Android app. During my third year in Cleveland, I worked for Matrix Pointe Software and Implemented a discussion module that allowed their customers to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>In fall of 2014, I began working in the Natural Perceptions Lab at CWRU under Dr. Michael Lewicki and Jing Chen. Working in that lab turned my interest in Computer Vision to an actual passion. I helped create the dataset the lab is currently using for it's experiments. My experience in the lab led me to have the idea for the 3D Scanner project as well as the expertise necessary to actually create it.</p>

<p>In fall of 2015, a few of my friends and I began a project to turn <a href="https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM">ORB-SLAM's</a> capabilities for creating sparse mappings of environements into a 3D Scanning app for Android. Below, you can find documentation for the project as well as links to the repos where the project is being actively developed</p>
