<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bio</h3>

<p>My name is Joshua Lee Tang. Born and raised in Paris, I have traveled the world quite a bit in my youth, leading me to be able to speak in five languages, three of which I can speak fluently. After graduating highschool with a Baccalaureat Scientifique, I started attending Case Western Reserve University, where I am currently a student. I am currently pursuing (and very close to getting) a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The summer of my Freshman year, I accidentally became the main developer for a startup that has long since disappeared. My sophomore year, I interned at Bird electronics and worked on connecting one of their sensors to an Android app. During my third year in Cleveland, I worked for Matrix Pointe Software and Implemented a discussion module that allowed their customers to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>In fall of 2014, I began working in the Natural Perceptions Lab at CWRU under Dr. Michael Lewicki and Jing Chen. Working in that lab turned my interest in Computer Vision to an actual passion. I helped create the dataset the lab is currently using for it's experiments. My experience in the lab led me to have the idea for the 3D Scanner project as well as the expertise necessary to actually create it.</p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
